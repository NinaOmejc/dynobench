# dynobench
The benchmark for system identification.

Currently, the repository includes folder "data" with datasets of individual dynamical systems, as well as main function "generate_data.py" to recreate the data. Additionally, coarsity and noise levels in the data can be adjusted (see function description in "generate_data.py").

Both coarse and dense data were used in the paper: 
Omejc et al., Probabilistic grammars for modeling dynamical systems from coarse, noisy, and partial data (in submission)
